# Discord bot character #

Thanks to [freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok), [freecodecamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/).

Create your own bot using online editor [Repl](https://repl.it/~) and python language.

## Prerequisite ##

  - Python 3.7.5 or above
  
  - pip install discord.py

## 1st step ##

### Create your own discord server ###

   - Go to [Discord](https://discord.com/) log in or sign up
   
   - Add a server
   
   - Add a bot using [discord developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   
     - add new application
     - Go to bot and Add Bot
     - Go to OAuth2 in SCOPES select bot and Bot Permissions select all Text Permissions except send TTS Messages
  
  - Copy the URL from SCOPES and paste to browser
  
  - Add the bot to the server you have created

## 2nd step ##

   - Go to [Repl](https://repl.it/~) Signup or Login.

## Create three file in repl: ##
  
  - In [main.py](https://github.com/MaRauder111/Discord_bot/blob/main/encourage_bot/keep_alive.py) the bot is created using python.
  
  - In [keep_alive.py](https://github.com/MaRauder111/Discord_bot/blob/main/encourage_bot/keep_alive.py) to keep the bot alive.
  
  - You need to create a .env file where you will add the bot link. *Waring* You should not share the code to anyone. Copy the code from [discord developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Bot -> Build-A-Bot -> Token -> Copy. Again this copy link should not be shared to anyone.

## NOTE ##
   
   - In the .env file write TOKEN = paste the url copy from the above step
   
   - The URL should not be share to anyone.

## 3rd step ##
## After the bot is created: ##

Ping the bot using [Uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).

## You are done. ##
